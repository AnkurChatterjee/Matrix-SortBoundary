# Matrix-SortBoundary
Program to display only the boundary elements of a matrix after sorting them in ascending order

### Problem statement
Write a file which will take a matrix from the user, print the original matrix and then print the matrix after sorting only the boundary elements in ascending order. The remaining elements of the matrix will remain intact. The program will also display the boundary elements in a square/rectangular fashion by omitting all the other elements from the matrix. Also display the sum of all the boundary elements.

After displaying the sum of boundary elements, the program will give the user two choices-
1. Continue
2. Exit

The program will keep on accepting inputs from the user until the user chooses to exit.

### Example
The sample inputs and their corresponding expected outputs are shown in the file "console.txt".
